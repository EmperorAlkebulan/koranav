The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis
- The build fails because Netlify runs the command configured in netlify.toml: "npm run build:frontend" but npm reports that the script "build:frontend" does not exist. See the error lines: [line 59-64](#L59-L64) and the failing command reference at [line 70-74](#L70-L74). Netlify also shows the configured build command from the resolved config at [line 76-83](#L76-L83).
- Vite was detected in the environment ([line 31](#L31)), so the project likely needs a Vite build command, but Netlify is calling a non-existent npm script.

Cause
- netlify.toml (or Netlify build settings) specifies npm run build:frontend, but package.json in the repo does not define a "build:frontend" script. Netlify therefore fails immediately with "Missing script: 'build:frontend'".

Solution
1. Verify what scripts exist in package.json
   - Inspect your package.json in the repo to see available scripts: https://github.com/EmperorAlkebulan/koranav/blob/main/package.json
   - Locally you can run: npm run to list scripts.

2. Apply one of these fixes (choose the one that matches your project intent) and commit the change.

   Option A — Add a build:frontend script to package.json (recommended if you want to keep netlify.toml unchanged)
   - Edit package.json and add a "build:frontend" script. For a Vite app a typical script is "vite build". Example snippet to add inside "scripts":
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:frontend": "vite build",
    "build": "vite build" /* keep or adapt existing scripts as needed */
  }
}
```
   - Commit and push. Then Netlify's "npm run build:frontend" will succeed if vite build is correct.
   - Test locally: npm run build:frontend

   Option B — Change the Netlify build command to an existing script (recommended if package.json already has a different build script)
   - Open netlify.toml in your repo: https://github.com/EmperorAlkebulan/koranav/blob/main/netlify.toml
   - Replace the build.command value with a script that exists (for example "npm run build" or directly "vite build"). Example change:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist" # adjust publish dir to match your build output
```
   - Commit and push. Netlify will run that command on the next deploy.

3. Ensure Netlify's publish directory matches your build output
   - Vite's default output folder is "dist". Your netlify.toml currently publishes "dist/public" ([line 82](#L82)). Verify your build actually produces dist/public or change publish to the correct folder (e.g., "dist") in netlify.toml.

4. Re-deploy on Netlify
   - After committing the changes, trigger a deploy. If you added the script, run it locally first to confirm there are no other build errors.

If you want, paste the current "scripts" section from package.json and I'll suggest the exact change to make.
