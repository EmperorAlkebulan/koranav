The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis

- Relevant error lines: build failed ([line 69](#L69)), the Rollup/Vite error says it "Could not resolve entry module 'index.html'" ([line 71](#L71)), and the Netlify build command that failed is shown ([line 85](#L85)). The Netlify publish directory is set to dist/public ([line 94](#L94)).
- Error type and cause: Vite/Rollup cannot find the HTML entry file. Vite expects an index.html at the project root (or the configured Vite root). This error means either:
  - index.html is missing or not committed to the repo, or
  - index.html is located in a different folder (e.g. public/ or src/) and Vite’s root/outDir are not configured to point to it (so Vite fails to resolve the entry).

Solution

1) Verify the file is present and committed
- Confirm that an index.html exists in your repository and was committed. If it lives in a subfolder, note its path (for example public/index.html). If it's missing, add and commit it to the repo.

2) Pick one fix depending on your project layout

A — index.html is in the repository root (recommended)
- If index.html is at the repo root, no special Vite config is required. Ensure it’s committed and then re-run the build:
  - Locally: npm install && npx vite build
  - On Netlify: retry deploy

B — index.html lives in a subfolder (e.g. public/)
- Option 1: Move index.html to the repo root (simplest).
- Option 2: Tell Vite where to find the HTML and where to output so it matches Netlify’s publish path. Example: if your index.html is at public/index.html and you want the final files in dist/public (so Netlify’s publish = dist/public is correct), add or update vite.config.js like this:

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  root: 'public',               // folder containing index.html
  build: {
    outDir: '../dist/public',   // relative to root: writes to <repo>/dist/public
    emptyOutDir: true
  }
})
```

- With this config, running npx vite build will use public/index.html as the entry and output to dist/public (matching your Netlify publish path shown in the logs [line 94](#L94)).

C — Alternative: keep Vite root but set rollup input
- If you prefer to keep root as project root, you can point the Rollup input to a non-root HTML, for example:

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { resolve } from 'path'

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        main: resolve(__dirname, 'public/index.html')
      }
    },
    outDir: 'dist/public'
  }
})
```

3) Ensure Netlify publish path matches the Vite outDir
- Your current Netlify resolved publish path is /opt/build/repo/dist/public ([line 94](#L94)). Either:
  - Keep Netlify publish = "dist/public" and configure Vite to output to dist/public (examples above), or
  - Change netlify.toml publish to "dist" (or whatever you use) if Vite outputs to dist.

4) Re-run the build
- Test locally: npm install && npx vite build — fix any errors locally first.
- Push the changes and redeploy on Netlify.

Why this fixes it
- The error in the logs explicitly shows Vite/Rollup could not resolve the entry "index.html" ([line 71](#L71)), so making sure index.html exists at the expected path or configuring Vite to look in the correct folder resolves the entry resolution failure and lets the build proceed.

If you still see Node version complaints or mismatches, update Netlify’s Node version per the docs: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript
